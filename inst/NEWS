Package: sfit
=============

Version: 0.3.0 [2012-10-07]
o CLEANUP: Now library("sfit", quietly=TRUE) attaches the package
  completely silently without any output message.
o CLEANUP: Now only importing 'R.methodsS3' (no longer attaching it).
o BUG FIX: Now declaring all S3 methods in NAMESPACE.


Version: 0.2.2 [2012-07-16]
o Now declaring S3 methods in NAMESPACE.
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd example lines are at most 100 characters long.
o Added an Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION.


Version: 0.2.1 [2012-03-23]
o Now package uses packageStartupMessage() instead of cat() when loaded.


Version: 0.2.0 [2011-05-15]
o ROBUSTNESS: If argument 'cfit' of cfit() is NULL, which happens if
  the 'cfit' option is not set, then cfit() will generate a warning
  explaining that it will rely on the operating system to find the
  "cfit" binary, which may not work.
o BUILD CLEANUP: Removed warning reporting on an uninitialized 'f'
  when building executable 'cli'.  This warning was unharmful
  and the "fix" makes no difference.
o BUILD BUG FIX: The makefiles for building package binaries assumed
  that a directory ../incl/bin/ existed.  Starting with R v2.13.0,
  empty ("skeleton") directories are automatically dropped (already
  when building the *.tar.gz), which caused error "`../inst/bin/':
  No such file or directory" during the binary builds.
o BUG FIX: If the 'cfit' binary had a comma in its path, cfit() would,
  if on Windows, throw an error reporting that the command "is not
  recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or
  batch file". Now such commas are escaped if on Windows.  See source
  code of findCfitBinary() for all details.


Version: 0.1.9 [2010-04-23]
o Added Rd help to argument 'verbose' of cfit() for the matrix class.


Version: 0.1.8 [2008-05-09]
o Removed obsolete SaveImage from DESCRIPTION.


Version: 0.1.7 [2008-08-31]
o Added drawApex() and radials() for class cfit.
o Renames old HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 0.1.6 [2008-02-14]
o cfit.matrix() now tests if the temporary data file was written/exists.
o Replaced dependency on R.oo with dependency on R.methodsS3.


Version: 0.1.5 [2007-06-12]
o Added a name space to the package.


Version: 0.1.4 [2007-06-10]
o BUG FIX: Internal lines3d() for 'cfit' queried non-existing objects.
o Package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.


Version: 0.1.3 [2007-05-20]
o WORKAROUND: On some Unix systems, cfit() would give output
  "sh: cfit: command not found".  This is because the sh shell
  has not be setup to identify executable in the current
  directory, i.e. they have to be called with "./cfit", but that
  does not work on Windows.  Instead, the cfit() is now calling
  pipe() with the absolute pathname to the cfit executable within
  quotation marks (to avoid problems with spaces) in the command
  string.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-07-21]
o Updated the help pages.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-20]
o First version of the package where the cfit binary is automatically
  build upon R CMD INSTALL.  It is still no shared library that is
  build, i.e. the approach to dump data to file, call 'cfit', and then
  let R parse the cfit result is still used.  But at least it should
  not (in theory) install and run on all platforms.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-05-07]
o Created.  Had a similar version in 2003.
