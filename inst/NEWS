Package: sfit
=============

Version: 0.1.9 [2010-04-23]
o Added Rd help to argument 'verbose' of cfit() for the matrix class.


Version: 0.1.8 [2008-05-09]
o Removed obsolete SaveImage from DESCRIPTION.


Version: 0.1.7 [2008-08-31]
o Added drawApex() and radials() for class cfit. 
o Renames old HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 0.1.6 [2008-02-14]
o cfit.matrix() now tests if the temporary data file was written/exists.
o Replaced dependency on R.oo with dependency on R.methodsS3.


Version: 0.1.5 [2007-06-12]
o Added a name space to the package.


Version: 0.1.4 [2007-06-10]
o BUG FIX: Internal lines3d() for 'cfit' queried non-existing objects.
o Package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.


Version: 0.1.3 [2007-05-20]
o WORKAROUND: On some Unix systems, cfit() would give output 
  "sh: cfit: command not found".  This is because the sh shell
  has not be setup to identify executable in the current 
  directory, i.e. they have to be called with "./cfit", but that
  does not work on Windows.  Instead, the cfit() is now calling
  pipe() with the absolute pathname to the cfit executable within
  quotation marks (to avoid problems with spaces) in the command 
  string.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-07-21]
o Updated the help pages.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-20]
o First version of the package where the cfit binary is automatically 
  build upon R CMD INSTALL.  It is still no shared library that is
  build, i.e. the approach to dump data to file, call 'cfit', and then
  let R parse the cfit result is still used.  But at least it should
  not (in theory) install and run on all platforms.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-05-07]
o Created.  Had a similar version in 2003.
