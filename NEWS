Package: sfit
=============

Version: 0.3.1-9001 [2022-03-09]

 * ...
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Native code would try to read from file even where there was nothing
   to read.  This was caught by the '-Wunused-result' compile option.
 

Version: 0.3.1 [2017-03-22]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now explicitly importing graphics, grDevices and utils functions.
 
 * ROBUSTNESS: Removed some clang compiler warnings and a harmless bug in a
   part of the C code that was never used by this package.
 
 
Version: 0.3.0 [2012-10-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now sfit::cfit() works (without having to attach the package).
 
 * CLEANUP: Now library("sfit", quietly=TRUE) attaches the package
   completely silently without any output message.

REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Now only importing 'R.methodsS3' (no longer attaching it).

 * Updated details on authors.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added cfitTests() to test the installation.
 
 * ROBUSTNESS: Added several system tests.

BUG FIXES:

 * Now declaring all S3 methods in NAMESPACE.
 
 
Version: 0.2.2 [2012-07-16]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Now declaring S3 methods in NAMESPACE.

 * Added an Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION.

 * CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd example lines are at most 100 characters long.
 
 
Version: 0.2.1 [2012-03-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now package uses packageStartupMessage() instead of cat() when loaded.
 
 
Version: 0.2.0 [2011-05-15]
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * ROBUSTNESS: If argument 'cfit' of cfit() is NULL, which happens if
   the 'cfit' option is not set, then cfit() will generate a warning
   explaining that it will rely on the operating system to find the
   "cfit" binary, which may not work.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * BUILD CLEANUP: Removed warning reporting on an uninitialized 'f'
   when building executable 'cli'.  This warning was unharmful
   and the "fix" makes no difference.

BUG FIXES:

 * BUILD BUG FIX: The makefiles for building package binaries assumed
   that a directory ../incl/bin/ existed.  Starting with R v2.13.0,
   empty ("skeleton") directories are automatically dropped (already
   when building the *.tar.gz), which caused error "`../inst/bin/':
   No such file or directory" during the binary builds.
 
 * If the 'cfit' binary had a comma in its path, cfit() would,
   if on Windows, throw an error reporting that the command "is not
   recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or
   batch file". Now such commas are escaped if on Windows.  See source
   code of findCfitBinary() for all details.
 
 
Version: 0.1.9 [2010-04-23]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added Rd help to argument 'verbose' of cfit() for the matrix class.
 
 
Version: 0.1.8 [2008-05-09]

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Removed obsolete SaveImage from DESCRIPTION.
 
 
Version: 0.1.7 [2008-08-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added drawApex() and radials() for class cfit.

REFACTORING:

 * Renames old HISTORY file to NEWS.
 
 
Version: 0.1.6 [2008-02-14]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * cfit.matrix() now tests if the temporary data file was written/exists.

REFACTORING:

 * Replaced dependency on R.oo with dependency on R.methodsS3.
 
 
Version: 0.1.5 [2007-06-12]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added a namespace to the package.
 
 
Version: 0.1.4 [2007-06-10]
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.

BUG FIXES:

 * Internal lines3d() for 'cfit' queried non-existing objects.
 
 
Version: 0.1.3 [2007-05-20]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * WORKAROUND: On some Unix systems, cfit() would give output
   "sh: cfit: command not found".  This is because the sh shell
   has not be setup to identify executable in the current
   directory, i.e. they have to be called with "./cfit", but that
   does not work on Windows.  Instead, the cfit() is now calling
   pipe() with the absolute pathname to the cfit executable within
   quotation marks (to avoid problems with spaces) in the command
   string.
 
 
Version: 0.1.2 [2006-07-21]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the help pages.
 
 
Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-20]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * First version of the package where the cfit binary is automatically
   build upon R CMD INSTALL.  It is still no shared library that is
   build, i.e. the approach to dump data to file, call 'cfit', and then
   let R parse the cfit result is still used.  But at least it should
   not (in theory) install and run on all platforms.
 
 
Version: 0.1.0 [2006-05-07]
 
NEW RELEASE:

 * Created.  Had a similar version in 2003.
